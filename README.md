#  Unemployment Analysis in India ðŸ“ˆ

### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze unemployment rate data in India using **Python** and popular data science libraries. The goal is to understand key trends and the impact of major economic factors, particularly the **COVID-19 pandemic**. The analysis provides valuable insights that can help inform more effective economic and social policies.

### Core Objectives

* **Trend Analysis**: Explore how the unemployment rate has changed over time and identify any seasonal patterns.
* **Impact Assessment**: Investigate the sharp changes in unemployment rates during the lockdown period due to the pandemic.
* **Insights and Findings**: Provide clear conclusions from the data to help understand the economic situation.

### Tools and Libraries Used

* `Python`
* `Pandas` for data manipulation
* `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization
* `Kagglehub` for data retrieval

### How to Run the Code

1.  Install the required libraries using `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn kagglehub`.
2.  Run the Python script in a suitable environment like **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.

### Key Findings from the Analysis ðŸ’¡

* **Pandemic-Driven Spike**: The analysis showed that the unemployment rate rose very significantly during the COVID-19 lockdown (March - May 2020), especially in urban areas, where it reached its highest level ever.
* **Regional Disparity**: Overall, unemployment rates were consistently higher in urban areas compared to rural areas.
* **Gradual Recovery**: After the peak of the crisis, the rates began to decrease gradually as economic activities resumed.
